        This is my final project for the my DIG4639 class at UCF! This was
        created in MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS! I already have
        experience with SQL databases and PHP and wanted to try a noSQL database
        and NodeJS, which I've heard so much about! I also created the api used
        to create, update, store, and delete users.
